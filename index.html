          <h3 class="title">The Beauty Of Nature Travel</h3>
          <p class="text">
            Whether you call it nature travel, sustainable travel or responsible
            ecotourism, there’s something incredibly potent, powerful, and
            cleansing about getting away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
            The air smells sweeter, the sun burns brighter, the colors seem more
            vivid, and time almost seems to stand still. Whether we’re hiking,
            kayaking, watching wildlife or just enjoying a quiet picnic, there’s
            something about unspoiled nature that simply soothes our soul. With
            Earth Day coming up April 22,
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            people tend to start thinking and talking about nature conservation
            more and more at this time of year. But our goal is to encourage
            people to embrace the beauty of nature and wildlife all year around.
            So when some of our blogging friends discussed having a monthly
            themed blog carnival, we immediately volunteered to host a Nature
            Travel round-up this month to draw more attention to the joys of
            ecotourism.

          <h3 class="title">Connecting to Care</h3>
          <p class="text">
            Can you think of a place in nature that you know really well? Close
            your eyes for a moment and see what comes up. Can you visualise the
            place in exquisite detail? The sounds, the colours, the smells, the
            subtleties that only you know. Do memories surface? Perhaps you have
            known this place for a long time. Maybe you spent golden moments
            from your childhood here? There might be happy memories tinged with
            sadness or regret? How does it feel when you bring this place to
            mind now? Please don’t rush.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            If you really have a deep connection with this place, it is likely
            that you might feel moved to do something. That’s obvious, right? We
            naturally and instinctively act to protect that which we care very
            deeply about. But what if that deep connection with a place is
            absent? How would that affect your response? It’s a beautiful place
            but it’s not your place. Are you still likely to do something about
            it? Is it your responsibility?

          <h3 class="title">How do heatwaves affect wildlife?</h3>
          <p class="text">
            Temperatures peaked above 40°C in several places and night-time
            temperatures were the highest ever recorded. It was also the driest
            July in over 20 years. Fuelled by greenhouse gases, climate change
            has already warmed the planet by around 1.1°C. This latest heatwave
            was relatively short-lived, but we’re set to experience more in the
            future.Our climate dictates the natural order, and an unsettled
            climate can throw the cycles of nature off-kilter. Take fruit and
            nuts – at our Nature's Calendar project, we received some of our
            earliest ever ripe blackberry records on 28 June.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            eatwaves often go hand-in-hand with drought. A lack of water can
            cause serious problems for trees and make it look as though you’re
            seeing a very early autumn. In dry weather, the sugars in leaves
            become concentrated and the leaves produce more anthocyanin (red and
            pink colour pigments).

          <h3 class="title">We Will Rebuild!</h3>
          <p class="text">
            In the midst of the carnage and human suffering that follows natural
            disasters, we often hear local officials and citizens proclaim that
            "We will rebuild." Of course, such expressions of hope and courage
            help to deflect the pain that they are feeling. While the statement
            makes sense after tornados, which randomly scour the landscape, such
            plans are not always advisable when the disaster unfolded in
            wildfire zones, along vulnerable coastlines or on inland
            floodplains.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            When hurricanes level barrier islands, when wildfires ravage forest
            communities and when floods sweep away towns in river valleys, it is
            time to yield to nature. After all, we have fueled the devastation
            and it will only worsen in the coming decades.
